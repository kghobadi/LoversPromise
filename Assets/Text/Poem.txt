On an already dense day, 
The air thickens and swelters
Filling the surroundings with a massive heat,
One that provides and shelters
all that lay within 

“Tomorrow is her birthday,”
I think to myself on the way out.
The way out. It is nowhere to be 
Found, and nothing can be done. 
I smiled at this thought. 

Nothing to be done. 
It was refreshing, no more
To worry, no more.
We are all to die soon. 
What shall I do ?

Now is the time to act,
Unevenly wring my hands 
around those whom I work for.
Who are you to decide my fate ?
I am but a man !
