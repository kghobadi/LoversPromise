I just keep having these thoughts lately. 
They go in a couple different directions. 
For one, I can't stop feeling uncertainty about my life choices. 
In the background, there is concern for growing political crises and apocalypse. 
The only thing that comforts me is my fantasies, which are growing further apart from reality.
Why can't I just be happy with the way things really are?
