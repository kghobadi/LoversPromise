I feel like I'm always lost in my memories lately. 
And as time goes on, I am for certain warping my memories by revisiting them.
If not warping, then adding at least. 
What really happened? How are we to know once time has passed that we remember correctly? 
We have to discuss with one another and reactivate each other's memories. 
In dialogue, we shed new light on the past, and open new possibilities for the future. 
Love can only emerge from successful dialogue.
