Listen, I must apologize. There’s really no other way to proceed. We have to push this city off its skyline, forcibly set in place those barriers that make it possible once again for them to realize the chaos all around them. They can’t see it during the day, most people can’t see it. They haven’t been marred as we have. They’ve suffered the only way they know how.
 But that doesn’t give much desire to discern, to intrude through that tiny spectrum into the deepest hope, the one that has lit the fires throughout the maze, yes you know the one.
