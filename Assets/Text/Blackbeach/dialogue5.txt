That's exactly what the Shapes are. They’re the physical remnant of the collision, of those points in time in which we exceed beyond this space, this realm we know, and we cross paths with thousands of other who've done differently, who've lived without such terror, or who have fallen victim to it. The Shapes are my way of saying to the world: Look! There is more to this than we know, or even I know. 
We cannot sit here and pretend everything is alright. By wading our way through politics, culture, identity itself, we are simply prolonging death, distracting from that imminent void. We must stand together and look up, as we have done before, but this time we must unite. National borders will dissolve, the Earth as we know it is dying. This planet, our mere existence and civilization, is arbitrary. It cannot last, that is a well known fact, but we must do our best to breakthrough the abyss that surrounds us. 
It is time to be bold, to sacrifice our human history, to bring down that leaning Tower of Babel and crumble it into the dust. You will rebuild this world from the rubble. Mark my words!
