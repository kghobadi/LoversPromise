“The right man in the wrong place can make all the difference.” What do you make of  that? I believe it is a betrayal of your character, one which we have not discussed. Why did you not come to me sooner? 
What proof must you find? I’m not hiding anything. One day, you will see for yourself you cannot enact judgment without the defining goal of a deadening blow, one to the foul head of any Shape.
