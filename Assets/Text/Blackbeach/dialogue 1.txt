You’ve come back to join us. It’s strange, I would have thought to leave you here. You’re safe here. The labyrinth offers you endless mysterium, wall upon wall of corn, not even the wind can penetrate it. 
Shapes will form, they will follow you, but it is here that at least you can tell the difference. Out there, there’s no hope for anyone. I am their last resort. They must listen to me. Do you not agree with what I have said?
