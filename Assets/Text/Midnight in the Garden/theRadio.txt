John:   Young men are falling by the thousands. It’s not anomalous, history has gone so far as to predict this! 
John:   In 1920, men were already predicting the probabilities of another Great War, many hoping it would come sooner than later.

John:   The fascist threat is nothing new. We just have a new name for it. Men of power flock to one another in times of need, as does the flock, the herd. They gather, and they are systematically slaughtered. 
John:   Men are no better than the meat they harvest. They are useless sacks of flesh, flesh that believes it has more of a right to consciousness than its peers.

John:   But at least at the end of the day we all still have each other.
