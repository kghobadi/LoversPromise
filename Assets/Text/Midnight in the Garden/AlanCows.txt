Alan:   You said it yourself. Take it one daaay at a time. 
Alan:   Humans want to save the world. Huuumans all believe they know the best way of living. They believe they can reeeorder the world to their liking. The truuuth is much duller than that. You are bound to nooo one but yourselves. You only have to saaave yourself, nobody else. Yet, you still have individuals whooo attempt to do much more than that. 
Alan:   Take a lesson from your mammaaalian friends. It is not all about saving. Sometimes peeeople don’t want to be saved. Sometimes, what they need is to be corralled. That is what happened to uuus, at least. Our civilization is 10,000 human years old aaand there is no longer anyone to save. We are all freee and we are all one. 
Alan:   Words fail me here. Words fail us all. Run alooong now. Find the rest, or dooo not. They can save themselves.
