Sean:   Stop right there. Loook at this. It is preposterous. 
Sean:   A waaaste of life. Precious, precious life. 
Sean:   Did you seee that hill back there? It’s good you didn’t jump. I did, buuut I just end up back here every time. 
Sean:   I am not like them. Something is wrooong with me. Maybe it has to do with the eggs. Come to think of it, they do reeelease a certain odor at night. 
Sean:   Every mooorning they open up, tentacles writhing, begging for muscle and mooomentum. Our species incubates and haaatches as a fully formed mind, or at least one that perceives itself as such. 
Sean:   Wisdom is a concept that haaas disappeared from our ranks. There is only creation, uuultimate knowledge, and then the choice: tooo return to the void, or to persist. 
Sean:   It is up to us. Buuut in the end, the same choice applies to you.
Sean:   Yes, that’s right. All things exist in the same fooorm. All life is one life. How could I haaave forgotten?
Sean:   That is why I chooose life. There is no choice, I mean to say. For if I aaam to choose one, I am also to choose the other. I caaannot experience death. I can interpret the void, buuut then it is only a conscious memory. We can meddle in the subcooonscious, but like you humans we have not truly conquered death. Not yet. We still cannot truuuly experience the unconscious. 
Sean:   It’s a shame really. Immortality arrived looong ago, but that only gave us more time to pose questions rather than to fiiind answers. Maybe that is what we live for anyway. 
Sean:   Sooo then. Baaack to the void with us both...
