The Pod: Hello there. I have not yet birthed, but I sense your presence. I sense your mind. 
You are beautiful. 
I would like to touch you if I could. I have dreamt of future embraces. 
I have seen beyond this shell and I see only holy communion with all things. Consciousness is a gift. Use it wisely.
